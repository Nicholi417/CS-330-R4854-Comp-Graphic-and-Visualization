# CS-330-R4854-Comp-Graphic-and-Visualization
This is the project done for class CS330

A picture was taken on the back porch of my apartment. It consisted of a childs square folding table, 2 books, a shoe box and three candles. The project is a reimagining of that in a computer 3d environment. 

As someone who has developed software only for data analysis, this entire project was new to me. I have never had to produce a visual effect before, most times it is just an import of data and an export of an excel sheet. As a mathematician I worked through the scene logically. The photo was something I designed and took myself so I chose objects that would not be too difficult for a first-time attempt, cylindrical candles, cubic books and shoeboxes, relatively simple shapes. This sort of reminded me of those art classes where you break down the scene into 2D geometric shapes to assist with painting. It was very similar, and a lot of basic scenes can be broken down like that.
 
One thing I did learn was how to read a lot of code. I went through a lot of the other projects to see how it handled later versions and was able to backwards engineer the code I need for a couple of the weeks. I was able to take one section at a time and develop it, then if that affected a previous section I would go back to that section. I worked with unrelated code, as in code not compiling in the same program, to figure out how to do different things. I don’t normally look at similar code.

If another class wants me to program a scene, I will be able to, though the last project only working on my computer is a bit alarming. I don’t really plan on doing too much with graphics in my profession. If it comes up, I will know how to do it. As my old Excel professor used to say, it is better to know that something is possible than to have that memorized. I have kept that in mind for a lot of things. I know I can build a scene, the code can be looked up if I need it again.
